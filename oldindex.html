<h2 class="center">My Story</h2>

<div class="center">
  <p><p> I first wanted to pursue social media (Instagram, YouTube, etc...) because I wanted to keep a record of where I've been, my personality, my intelligence, and my growth; to encourage me on my journey . Now, I realize telling the challenges and obstacles I've experienced can inspire. So thank you all for joining me on my journey and I hope my story can have an impact on you! </p>
     <p>Things happen in our lives; we encounter challenges that we may not have chosen to experience. But our choice comes in when we chose how to react to them.</p>


     <p>‚ÄúFor me, becoming isn't about arriving somewhere or achieving a certain aim. I see it instead as forward motion, a means of evolving, a way to reach continuously toward a better self. The journey doesn't end‚Ä¶.‚Äù</p>
